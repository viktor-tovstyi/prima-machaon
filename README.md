# Prima MachaOn  

**Prima MachaOn** is an example project demonstrating how to leverage the **Machanism platform** for the creation of a dedicated customer-oriented application. It showcases the practical integration of reusable libraries and modules from **Machanism Seed Projects** and Non-Seed Projects, while adhering to the core principles of **Clean Architecture**â€”modularity, reusability, scalability, and maintainability.  

This project provides a complete, operational implementation that developers can use as a reference or blueprint for building customized systems with Machanism libraries. It includes deployment configurations and application-specific adaptations tailored to meet real-world customer requirements.

## About Prima MachaOn  

Prima MachaOn was created based on the resources provided by the **[MachaOn](https://macha.machanism.org/machaon/containers-machaon/azure-containers/azure-aks-machaon)** project. It utilizes the foundational deployment configurations and reusable components available from the MachaOn ecosystem, demonstrating how to:  
- Integrate **Core libraries** and **Applications modules** available within Machanism Seed Projects.  
- Customize workflows and add customer-specific requirements.  
- Deploy an application to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** using containerization best practices.

This repository offers a concrete, step-by-step example of implementing a MachaOn Project for a business-specific use case.
