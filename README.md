# Prima-MachaOn

**Prima-MachaOn** is an example project demonstrating how to use the **Machanism platform** to create a dedicated, deployment-ready customer application. By leveraging the **modular architecture** of Machanism, Prima-MachaOn integrates reusable libraries and components from **Seed Projects** to deliver custom functionality in a scalable, maintainable, and adaptable manner.

This project specifically relies on the **Macha** and **Machb** Seed Projects as dependencies to showcase how existing modular libraries can be combined and extended to meet specific customer needs. Prima-MachaOn serves as both a reference implementation and a practical template for building real-world applications in alignment with **Clean Architecture principles**.

## References

- [Seed Project: Macha](https://macha.machanism.org): A library designed for the e-commerce domain, written in Java and TypeScript.  
- [Seed Project: Machb](https://machb.machanism.org): A complementary library for the e-commerce domain, implemented in TypeScript.

## Key Features

- **Modular and Reusable:** Built entirely using task-focused, reusable components from Machanism Seed Projects.
- **Customer-Specific Logic:** Extends the functionality of Macha and Machb Seed libraries to implement features tailored to Prima's requirements.
- **Clean Architecture Compliant:** Follows Machanism's architectural principles to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- **Deployment Ready:** Fully operational system configured for deployment, acting as a blueprint for customer-specific projects.

## Requirements

To work with Prima-MachaOn, ensure you have the following set up:
- Access to **Machanism’s artifact repositories** (e.g., Maven, NPM) to resolve dependencies for Macha and Machb.
- Familiarity with the **Machanism platform** ([Introduction to Machanism](https://machanism.org)) and **Seed Projects** ([Seed Project Overview](https://machanism.org/seed-project)).

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Prima-MachaOn leverages the Macha and Machb libraries. Ensure you configure your package or build manager (e.g., Maven for Java, NPM for TypeScript) to pull these dependencies from the Machanism artifact repository.

2. **Understand the Project Structure:**  
   Prima-MachaOn follows the Machanism project hierarchy:
   - **Core Modules**: Contain reusable entities and base functionality.
   - **Applications Layer**: Adapts the Core libraries for customer-specific workflows.
   - **Deployment Configuration**: Combines all components to produce the fully functional application.

3. **Run and Test:**  
   Configure, build, and run Prima-MachaOn to explore how the components integrate seamlessly to create a customer-ready system.

4. **Customize Further:**  
   Use Prima-MachaOn as a reference to extend or tailor functionality for your own specific business needs.
